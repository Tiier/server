# Tiier Server

This is the Node.js backend for Tiier

I will list the API documentation as I go, but I would like to build this out using Nodejs and then later rebuild it in other languages as a learning tool!

The servers for the live game will probably always be on Node unless I build a more optimal API in another language.
